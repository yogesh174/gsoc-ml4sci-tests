# Challenge - Multi-Class Classification 

Gravitational lensing has been a cornerstone in many cosmology experiments and studies since it was discussed in Einsteinâ€™s calculations back in 1936 and discovered in 1979, and one area of particular interest is the study of dark matter via substructure in strong lensing images. In this challenge, we focus on exploring the potential of supervised models in identifying dark matter based on simulated strong lensing images with different substructure.

### Dataset

The Dataset consists of three classes, strong lensing images with no substructure, spherical substructure, and vortex substructure. The images have been normalized using min-max normalization.
